Date of README creation: 2015 April 15

Uses an Arduino (currently using arduino Uno) to graph and plot the serial output from a pin.

This measures voltage.
The voltage is changed by a NTC thermistor, which at of the date of writing has not been callibrated yet.

This will write into a file named temperaturelog, which is admittedly unremarkable and might need future updates for proper house keeping.

TO DO:
------
- Make it save into text files every hour, and zip it using gzip
- Callibrate the thermistor.

Dependencies:
- pyserial
- pyqtgraph
- An arduino with a computer attached. Seriously
