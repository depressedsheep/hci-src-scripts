This script will graph serial outputs of 10 different Analog pins from an Arduino. As of writing, we're using an Arduino Leonardo.

Things to note:
- It uses a microUSB cable
- The Leonardo is cheeky and has to be reset everytime you upload something new
- This is for the Amazing Science X Challenge
- It logs at 100 Hz

Dependencies (the ones you might have to install):
- pyqtgraph
- pyserial
- An Arduino with a computer connected to it, obviously
